# COLD: Constructing Ontology-based Linked Data

<img src="docs/assets/img/cold_logo.png" alt="cold-logo" width="100%">

COLD is a Python package for generating and validating battery-related linked data. It provides tools for structuring battery metadata and test data into RDF/JSON-LD formats using an ontology-driven approach. cold ensures that generated data adheres to well-defined ontologies, making it easy to integrate with semantic web technologies and battery digital twin ecosystems.

## Features

- Ontology-Driven Linked Data Generation: Creates structured RDF/JSON-LD descriptions using EMMO and domain-specific battery ontologies.  
- Validation of Linked Data: Ensures data correctness by checking against predefined ontology schemas.  
- Metadata Structuring: Transforms raw battery test data into standardized linked data formats.  
- Seamless Integration: Designed to work with battery ontologies and digital twin ecosystems.  

## Usage

- Documentation on how to install and get started can be found here: [https://digibatt.github.io/cold/](https://digibatt.github.io/cold/)

## Roadmap

- Enhanced Ontology Support: Expanding compatibility with more battery domain ontologies.  
- Improved Validation Features: More detailed error reporting and schema checking.  
- Extended Metadata Handling: Support for additional battery test data types.
